This directory contains Silvaco ATLAS TCAD input scripts used to define and simulate the Double-Gate n-type TFET device structure. These scripts specify the device
geometry, material properties, doping profiles, meshing, and bias conditions required to generate physics-consistent I<sub>DS</sub>–V<sub>GS</sub> datasets
for machine learning surrogate modeling.
