# tfet-tcad-ml-prediction
Machine learning–based modeling of Double-Gate TFET characteristics using Silvaco ATLAS TCAD simulations and regression models for fast I<sub>DS</sub> prediction.

__Motivation & Research Significance__

Tunnel Field-Effect Transistors (TFETs) are widely regarded as promising candidates for next-generation ultra-low-power electronics, owing to their ability to achieve sub-60 mV/dec subthreshold swing and extremely low OFF-state leakage. However, the predictive modeling of TFETs relies heavily on Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) simulations, which become computationally prohibitive when sweeping multiple structural and bias parameters.

This work addresses this challenge by developing a machine learning–based modeling framework that learns TFET behavior directly from physics-accurate TCAD data, enabling:

• Rapid exploration of TFET design space

• Significant reduction in simulation time

• Preservation of underlying device physics

The approach connects detailed semiconductor device physics with practical, data-driven modeling techniques.

Dominant Transport Mechanism: Non-local Band-to-Band Tunneling (BTBT)

Accurate modeling of tunneling-dominated ON-state conduction and ultra-low OFF-state leakage

• __Machine Learning Framework__

A high-fidelity dataset generated from TCAD simulations is used to train regression models that predict drain current (I<sub>DS</sub>) as a function of device geometry and biasing conditions.

Implemented Models

• Decision Tree Regressor

• Random Forest Regressor

• Gradient Boosting Regressor

• LightGBM

• XGBoost

• Polynomial Regression

The selected regression models were chosen to capture the strong nonlinearity and bias-dependent behavior inherent to tunneling-dominated TFET operation. Tree-based and ensemble methods are particularly well suited for learning sharp transitions, threshold shifts, and multi-parameter interactions present in TCAD-generated datasets, while remaining robust to scaling and feature correlation. Polynomial regression was included as a baseline to evaluate the benefits of nonlinear ensemble learning over simpler parametric models.

__Dataset & Parameter Space__

__Input Parameters__

• Gate Work Function (φ<sub>gate</sub>)

• Gate Length (L<sub>G</sub>)

• Gate-Source Voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>)

• Drain-Source Voltage (V<sub>DS</sub>)

__Target Output__

• Drain Current (I<sub>DS</sub>)

All datasets were generated exclusively using Silvaco ATLAS, ensuring physics-consistent and noise-free training data suitable for modeling.

__Parameter Configuration for ML Dataset__

The machine learning dataset was generated by performing systematic TCAD simulations with a combination of fixed structural parameters and swept electrical parameters.
This approach ensures physics-consistent data generation while enabling effective learning of device behavior across relevant bias conditions.

• Fixed Parameters

- Gate Length (L<sub>G</sub>)
- Oxide Thickness (T<sub>OX</sub>)
- Silicon Body Thickness (T<sub>Si</sub>)
- Channel Doping (N<sub>Si</sub>)
- Drain Doping (N<sub>D</sub>)
- Source Doping (N<sub>S</sub>)
These parameters were held constant to isolate the impact of biasing and electrostatic control on TFET performance.

• Swept Parameters and Ranges

| Parameter | Range |
|---------|------|
| Gate Work Function (φ<sub>gate</sub>) | 4.4 eV – 4.6 eV (step = 0.1 eV) |
| Drain–Source Voltage (V<sub>DS</sub>) | 0.5 V, 1.0 V |
| Gate–Source Voltage (V<sub>GS</sub>) | 0 – 1.5 V (step = 0.005 V) |

This parameter selection captures both subthreshold and superthreshold region, enabling the ML models to accurately learn TFET behavior across practical operating conditions.

__Results & Key Observations__

All I<sub>DS</sub>–V<sub>GS</sub> characteristics and comparison plots were generated using OriginPro 2025b, enabling:

• High-precision scientific visualization

• Accurate log-scale representation of subthreshold behavior

• Publication-quality comparison between TCAD and ML results
